# Mathematical Reasoning

Perform rigorous mathematical reasoning and produce publication-quality LaTeX output.

## Input

- `$0` — Task type: `derive`, `prove`, `formalize`, `stats`, `notation`, `verify`
- `$1` — Context: equation, theorem statement, problem description, or data description

## Tasks

### `derive` — Step-by-step equation derivation
Show every intermediate step. Justify each with the rule applied. Box final result with `\boxed{}`. Number important equations with `\label{eq:name}`.

### `prove` — Formal theorem proof
Use appropriate technique: direct, contradiction, induction, construction, or cases. See `references/proof-templates.md` for LaTeX templates.

### `formalize` — Problem setting formalization
Convert informal description into formal mathematical framework with: variable definitions, domain/range specifications, assumptions, objective function.

### `stats` — Statistical test selection
Use the decision tree in `references/notation-guide.md` to select appropriate tests. Report p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals.

### `notation` — Generate notation table
Create a `\begin{table}` with all symbols used in the paper. Use standard ML notation from `references/notation-guide.md`.

### `verify` — Check mathematical correctness
Verify: dimensional consistency, boundary cases, gradient computations, notation consistency across sections.

## References

- Standard ML notation + statistical tests: `~/.claude/skills/math-reasoning/references/notation-guide.md`
- Proof templates and theorem environments: `~/.claude/skills/math-reasoning/references/proof-templates.md`

## Rules

- Define ALL symbols before first use: "Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote..."
- Use consistent notation throughout the paper
- Number equations that are referenced later
- Use `\tag{reason}` for key derivation steps
- State assumptions explicitly
- Cite lemmas and prior results used in proofs
